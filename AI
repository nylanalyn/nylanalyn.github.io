Listen. I like AI. I realize this is an unpopular opinion in the communities I tend to follow.
A lot of people hate it. For taking jobs, being soulless, doing art badly. Doing code badly.
I am not an artist, nor am I a coder generally.
I hack at stuff a lot, poke and prod. Things that are broken work again, but nothing is really created.
AI though? I have suddenly written a lot of things! Made clients for various API's, terminal clients for music services, all sorts of silly things.
I wouldn't say I made them, I wouldn't say they were good, I wouldn't even bother sharing them. You can make your own! You don't need mine.
The thing is, they wouldn't even exist without the AI. I am enjoying throwing things at it, and finding out what it can do! I'm enjoying using my own private software stack!
Shit, I'm enjoying throwing this text at it, and saying make me a website.
The theme is my colorscheme, but a lot of those ports are AI. I can't keep track of shit, and it just works.
I don't want to sell this like I think AI is great. I am aware of the issues, I dislike a lot of the things happening with it.
I agree art should probably be done by human artists, not soulless machines. Yet, sometimes? Sometimes I just need a quick drawing of a cityscape to use as my wallpaper. Not a month long experience as I wait for a human to draw it sorta like I want.
Is that wrong? Almost certainly. I can't really take it back though. I don't want to lie about my hatred for AI, whilst using it. That feels worse.
I prefer to just be honest, and say I am having a lot of fun doing things like this, silly, unimportant things.
