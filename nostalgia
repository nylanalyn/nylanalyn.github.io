There's something to be said for nostalgia.
I remember late nights, sat at my computer. The warm glow of the monitor, the gentle hum of the fans. The matrix of it. The hackers of it. I was never good at being the model of a 90's/2000's nerd. I tend towards a certain amount of failure to be anything, except I suppose myself.
Sometimes myself too I guess. It's hard not to wear a mask when the world seems angry at you.
What else I remember, is the lonliness. The slow descent into misery. That happens less now, occasional bouts of realization that no matter what we're all in this alone, passing ships and all that.
but still. less. I think that's important. To know such things are passing. Everything is I suppose.
For now, I sleep in electric dreams, and remember neon lights on rain filled streets.
