                        I've redesigned the site with a new Electric Dreams theme.
                        Dark backgrounds, neon colors, and a whole lot of vibes.
                        This is where I'll be sharing thoughts, projects, and whatever else
                        comes to mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The aesthetic is inspired by late-night coding sessions,
                        synthwave nostalgia, and the glow of terminal windows at 3am.

                        There's something to be said for nostalgia.
                        I remember late nights, sat at my computer. The warm glow of the monitor, the gentle hum of the fans. The matrix of it. The hackers of it. I was never good at being the model of a 90's/2000's nerd. I tend towards a certain amount of failure to be anything, except I suppose myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes myself too I guess. It's hard not to wear a mask when the world seems angry at you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What else I remember, is the lonliness. The slow descent into misery. That happens less now, occasional bouts of realization that no matter what we're all in this alone, passing ships and all that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        but still. less. I think that's important. To know such things are passing. Everything is I suppose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For now, I sleep in electric dreams, and remember neon lights on rain filled streets.
