                        I am confused by the AI boom. Not so much by it existing, more by the fact that I am unsure how to feel about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Listen, I am a talentless hack. In a lot of ways, I fail to do cool things. Not because I am out of ideas, or devoid of thought, or whatever else the options may be, but because I work all day, I have a family, friends to keep up with. These are just excuses of course, plenty of people who are way busier than I manage to acheive things way bigger than I. Still, the thing is, I desire to create. I want to make stuff. Not for other people, just for me to enjoy. I don't mind sharing the stuff, but I don't make it for others.

                        AI has been really useful for that. I want a music player that runs in the terminal and can connect to my navidrome account? VScodium and claude code got my back, ten minutes in and it's done and looks awesome, works ok. A few weeks of effort and it's exactly what I need.

                    <p>
                        I could go talk to someone on fiver, or whatever the thing is these days, and pay them to work on it, and constantly poke and prod at it, sure. I won't though. It just would never exist, and that's also fine I guess. It's not needed. No one will lose out except me, and I don't really matter all that much.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The thing is. I didn't make this. It wasn't me. It was a computer somewhere that put it together, some crazily complex system in the distance that slapped other peoples work together to create a thing that did what I want. Does that make it worthless? I don't know. If I write code in python, I am not talking directly to the computer either I guess? I'm using something else to interpret what I want the computer to do, and the code is swapping it to 1's and 0's. In that case though, it is still ME giving the instructions I suppose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I guess, what I am saying is, I don't know if AI is a good idea, I don't want to see people fired cos you can just make AI do it, and I don't want artists not paid cos chatGPT is good enough. Obviously there's no way to put it back in it's box at this point, but I get the issues with it. The thing is, I'm having fun with it. I have made all kinds of crazy things. The theme wouldn't exist properly without it. This website is mostly done using it. A lot of the ports are done with AI for the theme because I can't keep track of what the hell goes where, but it can.

                        I don't want to get rid of AI. I like AI. I have been using it a lot to do a lot of fun things, and I am honestly having a lot of fun.

                    <p>
                        I don't know if that means I should be ashamed or not. Probably.
